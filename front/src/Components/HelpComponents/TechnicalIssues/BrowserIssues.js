        Internet browsers are gateways through which we interact with web
        content. If part of the gateway isn’t working properly, it can cause
        issues with many different components of a site. Some common problems
        caused by browser issues are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Buttons not working</li>
        <li>Parts of the page missing or appearing differently</li>
        <li>Information not saving after entering it on the page</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you’re experiencing a technical issue with Gahimart, the first thing
        to check is your browser.
      </p>
      <span className="heading">Recommended Browsers</span>
      <p>
        While most major browsers are supported, we recommend that you use
        Google Chrome for the best experience with Gadhimart.
