        We want to minimize many risks as possilble. Therefore, for anyone under
        13 years of age, we ask that you have your parent/guardian respond to
        any ads you may be interested in. Also, if you wish to post an ad on
        Gadhimart, have your parent/guardian do so on your behalf, so they can
        be directly involved in the transaction.
