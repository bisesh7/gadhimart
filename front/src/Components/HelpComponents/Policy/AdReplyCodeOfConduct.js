        While Gadhimart does not actively monitor replies sent within our system
        between users, we reserve the right to delete or ban those who we deem
        to be using replies inappropriately.
      </p>
      <span>When contacting other users:</span>
      <ul>
        <li>Please treat them with courtesy and respect.</li>
        <li>
          Please do not reply to ads with unsolicited opinions, comments, or
          judgements on the content of the ads or about the poster.
        </li>
        <li>
          All replies to ads must be in connection to what the ad is offering.
          Replies regarding other commercial offers are not permitted.
        </li>
        <li>
          Abusive ad replies are not permitted. Any replies containing hate
          speech or defamation are strictly prohibited.

        <li>
          Impersonating other users, including supplying fake phone numbers is
          not permitted, and those who are found to be doing so may lose the
          ability to use Gadhimart.
