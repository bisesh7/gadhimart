          When purchasing items as expensive as a vehicle, buyers are looking
          for as much information as possible, so the more you provide, the
          better. Adding your TRIM information will tell buyers more about the
          car’s make, model. It also shows that you’re a trustworthy, serious
          seller, which will attract more serious buyers and save you time
          answering questions.

          A TRIM is a variation of the standard set of features on a specific
          vehicle’s make and model (e.g., like the difference between having an
          iPhone 12 or 12 Pro Max). The TRIM is indicated at the end of the
          vehicle’s make and model. For example, in the Ford EcoSport SE or Ford
          EcoSport Titanium the SE and Titanium are the trims.

          not have a Trim.

          Addig your Trim will add more specific information about your vehicle
          that might catch a buyer’s eye. Some buyers may also be looking for a
          specific Trim variant if they’re looking for a feature like a sunroof
          or leather seats.
