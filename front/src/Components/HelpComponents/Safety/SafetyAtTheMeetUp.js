      <h2>Safety At The Meet Up</h2>
      <p>
        Once you’ve come to an agreement and decided you’re going to make the
        trade, it’s important to meet in person. Meeting in person helps to
        prevent miscommunication, allows you to inspect the vehicle one last
        time, and reduces the risk of scams.
      </p>
      <strong>Agree on a Safe Location</strong>
      <p>
        A public location will help ensure safety for both parties, especially
        if you can’t meet until the evening. Try to choose somewhere with plenty
        of light, other people, and if possible, security cameras. The parking
        lots of coffee shops, fast food restaurants, or even police stations are
        good choices.
      </p>
      <strong>Bring a Friend</strong>
      <p>
        Bringing a friend or family member with you is always a good idea. They
        can keep you company while you’re waiting, and help ensure everything
        goes smoothly.
      </p>
      <strong>Inspect What You're Buying Carefully</strong>
      <p>
        Even if you’ve seen photos and the seller ensures you that it’s in
        perfect condition, it’s important to inspect the vehicle thoroughly
        first. Even genuine sellers may not notice small stains or other issues.
        If the seller agrees, taking the vehicle to a mechanic together to have
        it inspected can settle any concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
        The inspection is equally important for a seller. Ensure that the buyer
        looks over the vehicle, gives it a test drive, and knows about any wear
        and tear beforehand. That last inspection will make sure that both you
        and the buyer are aware of the vehicle’s condition. The goal is for
        nothing to be left unsaid that could cause issues later.
