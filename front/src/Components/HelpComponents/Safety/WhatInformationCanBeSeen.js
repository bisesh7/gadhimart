      <h2>What Information Can Be Seen When I Post?</h2>
      <p>
        In this day and age, privacy is always a top concern. Gadhimart only
        shares the contact information that you want to show. Be cautious when
        including certain types of information within the body of your ad.
      </p>
      <strong>Emails And Phone Numbers</strong>
      <p>
        By default, emails are not shown and phone numbers are shown only if you
        want to. It can be tempting to include contact information in the body
        of your ad to speed up communication. However, by putting this
        information in the description you’re side-stepping the protections that
        are in place. This can increase the chance that you’ll be contacted by
        those who would otherwise not be able to get around our security
        measures.
      </p>
      <strong>Your Name</strong>
      <p>
        The name in your Profile is the name that will appear on your ads. It’s
        safest to use your first name only, or even a nickname. Including your
        last name is never recommended.
      </p>
      <strong>Photos</strong>
      <p>
        When taking photos of your item, pay attention to the details in the
        background. If you’re taking a photo of your vehicle, is your house
        number in the background? Is your motorcycle always in the same spot,
        unlocked? Cases of theft are extremely rare, but ensuring that your
        photos are taken with a neutral background could avoid any potential
        issues.
