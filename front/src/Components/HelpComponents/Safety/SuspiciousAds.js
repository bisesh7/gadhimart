      <h2>Suspicious Ads</h2>
      <p>
        Most ads on Gadhimart are posted by genuine sellers. However, when you
        are buying or selling online, it’s important to know how to recognize
        suspicious ads. There are a few warning signs to watch out for.
      </p>
      <strong>Too Good to be True Deals</strong>
      <p>
        In order to try and lure people into their scam, fraudsters will offer a
        deal that’s hard to refuse. They are likely to offer recent or popular
        models at a fraction of the cost of similar vehicles. They usually have
        low kilometers, are in great condition, and have never had any issues.
        If any vehicle seems to be too good a deal, be cautious.
        <br />
        If you’re selling the vehicle, they may offer you more than asking
        price, or may want to buy everything you have for sale all at once. They
        may even offer extra if you remove the ad right away to “ensure the
        sale”.
      </p>
      <strong>Stock Photos</strong>
      <p>
        In most cases, fraudsters don’t actually have the vehicle they’re
        selling. Instead, they pull photos from online. They often choose the
        best quality photos, that are the most likely to convince you to buy.
        One quick method to check if the photos are genuine is to do a quick
        image search.
        <br /> Note: While stock images can be a bad sign, they don’t
        necessarily mean an ad is a scam. Genuine sellers do sometimes use
        images from online, especially if the item is new. Don’t worry unless
        you see other red flags as well. If you’re unsure, you can always
        request original photos.
      </p>
      <strong>Email in Their Ad</strong>
      <p>
        Fraudsters will often request that you leave Gadhimart and contact them
        through a private platform. This helps them to avoid our security
        systems. If they ask you to reply to their personal email address
        instead of Gadhimart Inbox, be cautious.
        <br />
        Tip: If for some reason a seller doesn’t want to use Gadhimart messages
        to communicate, ask to give them a call. Fraudsters will rarely speak
        directly over the phone.
