      <h2>Quick Safety Tips</h2>
      <p>
        While most members of Gadhimart have good experiences, it’s important to
        stay alert and educated about how to stay safe.
      </p>
      <strong>Know The Market</strong>
      <p>
        It’s important to know what the average cost of the vehicle you’re
        looking for is in comparison to the ad you’re viewing. If it’s hundreds
        or even thousands less than similar vehicles, be careful. Fraudsters
        often post a once-in-a-lifetime deal to pull in as many people as
        possible. The common saying stands: if it’s too good to be true, it
        probably is!
      </p>
      <strong>Don’t Give Out Personal Information</strong>
      <p>
        When speaking to individuals online, it’s important to be cautious when
        giving out information. Never give out your identification or banking
        details unless you are 100% sure that you’re speaking with the real
        company. <b>Note:</b> Gadhimart will never ask for your identification,
        passwords, or banking details.
      </p>
      <strong>Meet in Person Before Paying</strong>
      <p>
        A Fraudster’s greatest tool is that online translations are anonymous.
        Don’t provide any money until after you’ve met them in person and had a
        chance to inspect the vehicle. We recommend that you meet in a busy,
        public location like the parking lot of a coffee shop.
      </p>
      <strong>Choose Safe Payment Methods</strong>
      <p>
        Many forms of money transfer can be faked or hard to reverse should
        anything go wrong. If you can’t use cash, please consider choosing your
        preferred third party, secure cashless payment method.
      </p>
      <strong>Trust Your Gut</strong>
      <p>
        Sometimes a sale just seems off. If anything isn’t sitting right with
        you, don’t be afraid to walk away. You are not obligated to follow
        through with a transaction even if you’ve already agreed to a price.
