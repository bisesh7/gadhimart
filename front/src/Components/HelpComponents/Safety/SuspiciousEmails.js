      <h2>Suspicious Emails</h2>
      <p>
        In an increasingly online world, it can be hard to know what’s
        suspicious and what’s not. There are two basic types of email scams that
        it’s important to be able to recognize.
      </p>
      <strong>Phising Emails</strong>
      <p>
        Phishing is when fraudsters pretend to be a legitimate company or person
        to gain access to your information. They are usually looking to get your
        account login details, financial information, or identification. <br />
        If you receive a phishing email, forward all suspicious email addresses
        and websites to spoof@gadhimart.ca and then immediately delete them.
      </p>
      <strong>Money Scams</strong>
      <p>
        Money scams are attempts to convince others to send them money, often in
        return for something that doesn’t actually exist. This is the most
        traditional type of scam. Many assume that only buyers are vulnerable to
        these types of scams, but there are some forms of these scams that
        target sellers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although they can come in many forms, they have similar warning signs:{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>They Move The Conversation To A New Platform</b>
        <br />
        To get around our security systems fraudsters will often request that
        you leave Gadhimart and contact them through a private platform. If they
        ask you to reply to their personal email address, be cautious.
        <br /> <b>Note:</b> Sometimes these requests can be legitimate, but if
        they refuse to speak anywhere other than through private email, it might
        be best to move on. Ask them to speak directly over the phone if they
        don’t want to use Gadhimart inbox.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>They Can’t Meet In Person</b>
        <br />
        Fraudsters operate remotely. This is partly because they need to cast a
        wide net to make money and partly for their own safety. They may have an
        elaborate excuse that makes them sound legitimate. Some common stories
        are that they work in a distant mining town, or that they’re buying a
        special present for a family member.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Odd Payment Requests</b>
        <br />
        Since Fraudsters don’t usually meet in person, they need the money
        digitally. They may ask that you send them money through an
        untrustworthy method. Favourites include E-sewa, Khalti, and other types
        of money transfer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scams aimed at buyers are generally simple, but there are two types:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>They ask you to pay for the vehicle before you meet up.</li>
        <li>They ask for a deposit for a vehicle you haven’t seen.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are 3 main types of scams aimed at sellers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>They insist that you ship the vehicle to them before payment.</li>
        <li>
          They send you a payment notification or receipt and ask you to
          transfer some funds back to them before the full payment comes
          through.
        </li>
        <li>
          They send you a fake payment notification or receipt, then ask you to
          transfer some of that money to a shipping company. They not only tell
          you which company, but what account number to use for the transfer.
        </li>
      </ul>
