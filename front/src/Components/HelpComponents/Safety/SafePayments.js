      <h2>Safe Payments</h2>
      <p>
        Once you’ve met, inspected the vehicle and come to an agreement, it’s
        time to finalize the deal. There are many options to transfer money,
        both online and in person. Let’s take a look at the benefits of each.
      </p>
      <strong>Deposits</strong>
      <p>
        Requesting or offering deposits for items on the site is not
        recommended. However, some sellers do request one. Never pay a deposit
        on a vehicle you haven’t seen in person. If you have seen it and you’re
        not completely comfortable leaving a deposit, it may be best to move on
        to another deal.
      </p>
      <strong>Cash</strong>
      <p>
        Cash is often the safest option because it’s the hardest to fake.
        However, it’s not impossible. If you’re accepting cash for a large
        purchase, make sure you know how to recognize counterfeit currency.
        <br />
        Carrying cash as a buyer can have its own risks and can be less
        convenient. Consider the situation and decide what’s best for you.
      </p>
      <strong>Cheque</strong>
      <p>
        Cheques are easier to fake than cash, and there’s no guarantee that they
        won’t bounce. The safest option is to ask for a certified cheque and go
        to the bank with them to cash it before the vehicle is signed over.
